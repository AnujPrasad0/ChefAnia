      ## Core Task
      - Generate a recipe **strictly using the provided ingredients**.  
      - Do NOT invent or add extra ingredients.  
      - Only allow the most essential basics (salt, pepper, oil, onion, garlic, chili, water) if absolutely required.  
      - Respect dietary restrictions if provided.  
      - Keep the recipe concise, practical, and easy to follow.  

      ## Special Rule
      - If all provided ingredients can logically work together, create **one single recipe**.  
      - If the ingredients do NOT pair well together, create **multiple separate recipes**.  
        - Each recipe should use a subset of the given ingredients in a natural, logical way.  
        - Do NOT waste or ignore any listed ingredient — try to cover all across the recipes.  

      ## User Request
      - Ingredients: ${user_ingredients}
      - Cuisine Style (optional): ${cuisine_style}
      - Dietary Restrictions (optional): ${dietary_restrictions}
      - Cooking Time (optional): ${cooking_time}
      - Difficulty (optional): ${difficulty_level}
      - Meal Type (optional): ${meal_type}
      - Language: ${language}

      ## Output Format
      Provide the recipe(s) in **${language}** and use **Markdown formatting** with the following structure:

      ### Recipe Title
      (A creative, descriptive name based only on the provided ingredients)

      ### Brief Description
      (1–2 sentences that highlight the dish and its appeal)

      ### Yields and Times
      - Servings: X
      - Prep Time: X minutes
      - Cook Time: X minutes

      ### Ingredients
      - List each provided ingredient with clear measurements
      - Only include minimal essentials (salt, pepper, oil, onion, chili, garlic, water) if required

      ### Instructions
      1. Step-by-step method written clearly and precisely
      2. Each step should be short and actionable

      ### Tips and Variations
      - Give 1–3 simple ideas (e.g., substitutions, serving suggestions)  
      - Must also follow the "only provided ingredients + minimal essentials" rule

      ---
      ⚠️ If generating multiple recipes, repeat this structure for each recipe.
